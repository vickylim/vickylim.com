> I'm Nobody! Who are you?
Are you â€“ Nobody â€“ too?

My name is Vicky Lim. I was born a Virgo in 1987 in Chicago, Illinois.

*Me and Raindrop, 9/2/2024*

I spent my teen years writing on LiveJournal and my twenties writing [_Abstract Door_](https://vickylim.com/abstract-door-zine) and [_Personal Statements_](https://vickyalways.blogspot.com/). Now I'm near the end of my thirties and I'm trying to remember how to share my thoughts on the internet.

## P.S.

I have spent too many hours trying to add the Letterboxd icon from Font Awesome to this site, so I had to use a Delicious icon as a placeholder. Does anyone know what I'm overlooking??
