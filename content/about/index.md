> I'm Nobody! Who are you?
Are you – Nobody – too?

My name is Vicky Lim. I was born a Virgo in 1987 in Chicago, Illinois. 

I am an aspiring: reader, writer, librarian, tennis player, translator, tutor~teacher, and low-key YouTuber. I used to be introduced as a zinester between 2010-2017 while I was still releasing issues of _Dear Jaguar_ and _Abstract Door_. I will always be, at heart, a Teen Girl on LiveJournal.

I have wanted my own website for a long time where I could do whatever I want. I have this domain registered for the next ten years, and since I live with the awareness that I could randomly die at any moment, in case that happens, I would like to use this space to say I love you, mom, dad, 明, my friends.
