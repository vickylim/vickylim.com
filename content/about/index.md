> I'm Nobody! Who are you?
Are you – Nobody – too?

My name is Vicky Lim. I was born a Virgo in 1987 in Chicago, Illinois.

I am currently a student of the classical guitar. I used to be introduced as a zinester between 2010-2017 while I was still releasing issues of _Dear Jaguar_ and _Abstract Door_. I will always be, at heart, a Teen Girl on LiveJournal.
