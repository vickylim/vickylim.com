> I'm Nobody! Who are you?
Are you â€“ Nobody â€“ too?

My name is Vicky Lim. I was born a Virgo in 1987 in Chicago, Illinois.

I spent my teen years writing on LiveJournal and my twenties as a zinester (_Dear Jaguar_ and [_Abstract Door_](https://vickylim.com/abstract-door-zine). Now I'm near the end of my thirties and I'm too all over the place to have a list of identities for a bio like this. I will still get excited to talk about: classical guitar, franÃ§ais, language learning, literature, tennis, strength training, and ä¸­æ–‡.
