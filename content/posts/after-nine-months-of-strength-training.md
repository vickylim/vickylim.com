I have entered the part of my programming where I am doing more volume work and hitting fewer PRs, which means there are many nights that feel "easy" this past quarter. It's nice. I also switched from the power clean to the power snatch, introduced paused squats once a week for six weeks, began using the "talon grip" for the squat (where the thumb and pinky are wrapped under the bar) to release tension from my wrists, and got [my own weightlifting belt](https://www.dominionstrengthtraining.com/product-page/starting-strength-3in-single-ply-leather-weightlifting-belt).

The toughest lift was the 185 lb. deadlift that I failed a few times in mid-April. My technique was off because I kept shifting my hips. The cues that help me the most are: PUSH THE FLOOR AWAY WITH YOUR FEET + STRAIGHT ELBOWS. But I still couldn't manage it, probably due to poor sleep and eating fewer calories. I felt a mild fatigue throughout my body. This is when I decided to wear my Fitbit to bed again and it has helped. Two months later, I was able to pull 185 off the floor, and that was the highlight of my day ðŸ˜Œ

In other news, I went on a first (and only) date with a competitive powerlifter in early May whose numbers really inspired me. She's an inch shorter than I am, weighs 198 lbs, and has been lifting for 4-5 years. She's currently squatting ~408 lbs, benching ~242.5 lbs, deadlifting ~460 lbs. Wtf!!! I was laughing in disbelief as she mentioned each one. I was looking up a "forecast" of where I could expect to be if I continued training for 10 years and it would not be anything close to the 1,000 lb. club.

**Positive things this past quarter:**
- the joy of using a new block of chalk
- met six new members at the gym
- unmounting and mounting my 35+ lb. bike from the wall without dreading it
- being able to help Vicki carry a free chair to her car
- feeling honored that Tom thought I could help spot him on his bench press
- smiling at my phone while replying to Beata's text and cracking up that Nathan, then Alex, noticed
- catching a rainbow outside with my gymmates (happy pride month)
