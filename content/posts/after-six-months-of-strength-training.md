**Things I've learned this past quarter:** skipping a single day will make it harder to squat the next time, never lift without eating right beforehand, you became detrained from replacing the deadlift with the power clean once a week which is why you failed a deadlift that should have been doable, and it's ok, you got back with four sets of three. And I'm having fun learning the clean :)

![Excerpt from my training journal](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/35595539/original_bcd67dcb1d544e40e308a89f4aeac655.jpg?1743211104?bc=0)

**Things I'm celebrating this past quarter:** that 135 lbs on the deadlift is now my _warmup_ once a week vs. last year in November when it took every ounce of effort out of me and my body actually squeaked lol, that I graduated to a new plate (25 lbs) on the bench press, that I am still #8 (last place, but I made it) on my gym's leaderboard for bench press for women (and that I'm nearing the 100-lb club), that I made it to the 45-lb plates on the squat, and that this gym is so supportive. I felt warmed by a few guys remarking on my squat milestone. Grateful for the coaches + the social that happened in February!

**Things I'm keeping in mind for this next quarter:** my failures are "neutral" and I will not be intimidated when I return to the weights I failed (140-lb squat, 180-lb deadlift). I will think about "disinhibition" with the goal of training until my inhibitory pathways "shrivel." Shoutout to [the Huberman Lab podcast episode](https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/pavel-tsatsouline-build-strength-endurance-flexibility-at-any-age) that was 4h long with Pavel Tsatsouline. I learned a lot about performance and emotions (3:00:58), and tbh, what these two men discussed, it boils down to the same theme I've been studying: SELF-COMPASSION.
