I remember feeling like such a poser wearing my Adidas track jacket while riding the train in September '21. It made me look athletic, but I was self-conscious because I did not do any kind of exercise at all. 

Next thing I know, it's September '24 and I'm walking around with a gym bag 3x a week so that I can go train at Starting Strength. I throw in my favorite 100% cotton t-shirt, pants, water bottle, one pair of shoes for squats and another for deadlifts, my training journal, and other misc items (still looking for a "lucky troll doll").

The gym is located in a plaza, adjacent to a daycare, and across the street from where I went to high school. Inside, there is just enough space for ten platforms, so you really get to know everyone who comes in during your same day and time. 

It's expensive for me in terms of time, money, and energy, but it's the only thing I want to do right now because I have fallen in love with the ritual of setting up, loading the bar with plates, and adding a little more weight each time.

I am greeted by the coach when I walk in. I nod hello to my gymmates. Then I choose the second-to-last power rack in the back, if it's free. I drop my gym bag on the bench, set my water and journal onto the tray under the stainless steel board and write out my worksets and warmups.

After I get changed and switch shoes, I adjust the knobs and safety pins on the rack for my height. Then I grab a 45-lb barbell and the shortest belt. Once everything is in place, I take a breath, step forward to roll my neck under the empty bar. My shoulders are always tight at first, but I begin to squat my first five reps.

As a complete novice, I learned the techniques of the lifts using an 11-lb bar. I started the program by squatting at 31 lbs, pressing at 21 lbs, benching at 31 lbs, and deadlifting at 51 lbs. I was adding 5 lbs to each lift every session for a month before I began going up by only 2.5 lbs. The initial linear progression is SO SATISFYING.

I am so eager to go in and energized when I leave. I haven't had any "bad days" at the gym yet. But there have been a couple disappointments, like spraining my right hip adductor and not being able to squat, or psyching myself out of deadlifting 137.5 lbs, which felt daunting because I was intimidated by the 45-lb plates.

The schedule demands commitment. Showing up and doing the lifts is definitely much easier than remembering to prioritize recovery. I could still be eating and sleeping better. I could still be walking more. But I'm glad to go at my own pace without the pressure that came earlier this year when I got excited to become A BODYBUILDER. What was I thinking??

I'm trying to be present one day at a time, but if I'm looking ahead, I would love to join the "600 lb plate club." In powerlifting, I learned this is when the three lifts add up to 600 lbs. So!
