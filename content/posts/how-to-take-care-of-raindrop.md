Raindrop, born March 6, 2020 in Texas. I adopted her from Tree House Humane Society.  

She is playful, and careful. She comes over to bed when she sees me plopping down for my routine post-workday rest. Yesterday she nuzzled her chin on my chest. 

List her likes, dislikes, routine, food, stuff, and how this is a public note in case someone needs to take care of her if I randomly died.
