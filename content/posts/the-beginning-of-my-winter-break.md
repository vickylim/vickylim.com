So, it's the first weekend of my winter break and I'm off for three weeks! I'm not going anywhere. My only plan is to "do nothing" and see what happens ü§†

Yesterday, I attended the first meeting of the [Classics Book Club](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-lbqzvmlr) to preview *Wuthering Heights* with 18 other people. I felt quite at ease in the library, sitting around a table with other readers, feeling like a student. It's been so long since I've joined a book club. I had given up on them because I would always fall behind schedule and show up unprepared to discuss anything. But I'm in a different mood now. I miss novels, and I want to read more deeply again. If I only finish 4 great books a year, that will be enough for me.

Then I went over to Phirany's dinner party (‚ù§Ô∏è). She invited a group of us over to motivate herself to cook Cambodian dishes. We mixed together a bowl of fried noodles with tofu, chives, shrimp, bean sprouts, and peanuts. My parents make a version of this with rice vermicelli and now I'd like to add this to the list to make it myself. There was also a stew with carrots and potatoes. WHAT IF I got a dining room table that could fit 8 people and then I could do the same thing??

Throughout the week, I've been writing notes on relationships. What can I offer, what can I not? It's been a helpful exercise, assigned by my new therapist. It's the second time I'm trying to see one, and this time, it's much better because I have clearer goals. The idea came after experiencing the ease of booking virtual appointments with my *physical* therapist. And you know how I like to solve problems. So I immediately scanned my life from top to bottom to think: ok! what else is bothering me?? (my attitude toward relationships, needing other people, feeling emotions, intimacy)

Today, I started the morning by dusting off my Chinese notebook and opening up Google Translate so that I can practice some Mandarin sentences with Melody. We're both at a similar level with how little we're able to speak, but we got on a video call and focused on a scenario between a grandma and granddaughter: "Have you eaten?", "Have you bathed?" and "Did you sleep well?" It really made me nostalgic for my commitment to language learning in late 2019 - maybe 2021.

Then, this afternoon, I learned how to boulder at First Ascent in Humboldt Park with Outdoor Asians Chicago x Asian Climbing Collective. I was eager to go because without a group, I would be intimidated to walk into this environment on my own. There is a bag of chalk, there are shoes to change into, routes on the walls that are numbered and color-coded, and the assumption that everyone in the space knows what they're doing, except you. I'd been curious to climb ever since watching *Free Solo*. I managed to finish a few very easy routes and get a hands-on reality check for how hard it is. Grateful for Matt guiding the complete first-timers. Met cool, friendly people + did not injure myself = success. Not ready to get obsessed with climbing just yet, but the community is so warm and strong, so it's on my mind. . .
