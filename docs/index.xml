      <description>I have lived in the same one-bedroom for over a decade now and spent many of those years coming in to sleep and going back out for another day of work. This routine was often followed by an evening class, a late-night concert, a hangout, or getting sidetracked by errands while on my long commute home. I never made enough time to take care of my space, so it was nonstop dusty and I was always disgusted by the clutter and piles of actual trash.</description>

      <description>I started the day busy with my backpack, trying to decide what to bring with nowhere to go. I&amp;rsquo;m taking a couple weeks off work for a winter break and determined not to squander any minute. I could venture out of my neighborhood, walking 10-20k steps, visiting libraries and museums, and either finish reading the remaining volumes of In Search of Lost Time or study the books I&amp;rsquo;ve collected this year on a shelf dedicated to physical health, sports, and meditation.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Nobody! Who are you? Are you – Nobody – too?
My name is Vicky Lim. I was born a Virgo in 1987 in Chicago, Illinois.
I used to be introduced as a zinester between 2010-2017 while I was still releasing issues of Dear Jaguar and Abstract Door. I will always be, at heart, a Teen Girl on LiveJournal.</description>

      <description>Out of nowhere on Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day this year, after one of my regular conversation practice sessions with my French tutor, I began searching online for Mandarin resources. In hindsight, I was probably looking for a distraction out of my intermediate plateau with French, where I am still struggling to stretch from B1 to B2. One click led to another until I decided to order Assimil: Le chinois, sealing my commitment that it will be the next language I learn.</description>

      <description>There is no blank page, Céline Sciamma wrote on the trading card I made of her. I held this mantra since February, 2020, the month before the start of the pandemic, and I still kept struggling to write.
To diminish my dread, I find it helpful to begin with either an epigraph or a few notes on what I aim to accomplish, so here is what I would like for this blog.</description>
