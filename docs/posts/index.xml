      <description>This is a collection of affirmations, mistakes, and reminders that I tried to post last year. They were pulled in loose chronological order from monthly reflections I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing for a while now.
There is &amp;ldquo;nothing to attain.&amp;rdquo; I do not have to write a novel before I die, nor read 1,000 books, nor pass beyond grade 8 on the classical guitar, nor climb upward at work. It is ok to step away (and never return) from any voluntary work that stresses me out mentally, physically, and emotionally.</description>

      <description>I have entered the part of my programming where I am doing more volume work and hitting fewer PRs, which means there are many nights that feel &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; this past quarter. It&amp;rsquo;s nice. I also switched from the power clean to the power snatch, introduced paused squats once a week for six weeks, began using the &amp;ldquo;talon grip&amp;rdquo; for the squat (where the thumb and pinky are wrapped under the bar) to release tension from my wrists, and got my own weightlifting belt.</description>

      <description>Things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned this past quarter: skipping a single day will make it harder to squat the next time, never lift without eating right beforehand, you became detrained from replacing the deadlift with the power clean once a week which is why you failed a deadlift that should have been doable, and it&amp;rsquo;s ok, you got back with four sets of three. And I&amp;rsquo;m having fun learning the clean :)</description>

      <title>My relationship with the classical guitar</title>

      <description>Written as a note-to-self on how I had fallen in love with the classical guitar, so that I don&amp;rsquo;t neglect it for so long again.
Just me, my guitar, and my cat, Raindrop. That was all I wanted to need when I fantasized about a devotion to studying the classical guitar on this day, a couple years ago. Prior, I had been thinking about the piano, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t very practical because I would have to travel toward one to practice.</description>

      <title>Intentions for 2025</title>

      <description>Prioritize connecting with other people. Meet new people (attend numerous meetups, community events), maintain existing friendships (be responsive to messages, send mail, suggest plans, welcome everyone into my home), and always make the trek, no matter the distance or weather or mood, esp. if I committed in advance.
Express more encouragement by recognizing positive efforts made by friends and colleagues, as opposed to noticing immediately what could be fixed or reacting with judgments.</description>

      <description>I remember feeling like such a poser wearing my Adidas track jacket while riding the train in September &amp;lsquo;21. It made me look athletic, but I was self-conscious because I did not do any kind of exercise at all.
Next thing I know, it&amp;rsquo;s September &amp;lsquo;24 and I&amp;rsquo;m walking around with a gym bag 3x a week so that I can go train at Starting Strength. I throw in my favorite 100% cotton t-shirt, pants, water bottle, one pair of shoes for squats and another for deadlifts, my training journal, and other misc items (still looking for a &amp;ldquo;lucky troll doll&amp;rdquo;).</description>

      <title>The beginning of my winter break</title>

      <description>So, it&amp;rsquo;s the first weekend of my winter break and I&amp;rsquo;m off for three weeks! I&amp;rsquo;m not going anywhere. My only plan is to &amp;ldquo;do nothing&amp;rdquo; and see what happens ðŸ¤ 
1 Yesterday, I attended the first meeting of the Classics Book Club to preview Wuthering Heights with 18 other people. I felt quite at ease in the library, sitting around a table with other readers, feeling like a student. It&amp;rsquo;s been so long since I&amp;rsquo;ve joined a book club.</description>

      <description>I have lived in the same one-bedroom for over a decade now and spent many of those years coming in to sleep and going back out for another day of work. This routine was often followed by an evening class, a late-night concert, a hangout, or getting sidetracked by errands while on my long commute home. I never made enough time to take care of my space, so it was nonstop dusty and I was always disgusted by the clutter and piles of actual trash.</description>

      <description>I started the day busy with my backpack, trying to decide what to bring with nowhere to go. I&amp;rsquo;m taking a couple weeks off work for a winter break and determined not to squander any minute. I could venture out of my neighborhood, walking 10-20k steps, visiting libraries and museums, and either finish reading the remaining volumes of In Search of Lost Time or study the books I&amp;rsquo;ve collected this year on a shelf dedicated to physical health, sports, and meditation.</description>

      <title>Learning Chinese in 2021</title>

      <description>Out of nowhere on Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day this year, after one of my regular conversation practice sessions with my French tutor, I began searching online for Mandarin resources. In hindsight, I was probably looking for a distraction out of my intermediate plateau with French, where I am still struggling to stretch from B1 to B2. One click led to another until I decided to order Assimil: Le chinois, sealing my commitment that it will be the next language I learn.</description>

      <description>There is no blank page, CÃ©line Sciamma wrote on the trading card I made of her. I held this mantra since February, 2020, the month before the start of the pandemic, and I still kept struggling to write.
To diminish my dread, I find it helpful to begin with either an epigraph or a few notes on what I aim to accomplish, so here is what I would like for this blog.</description>
