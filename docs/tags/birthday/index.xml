      <description>This is a collection of affirmations, mistakes, and reminders that I tried to post last year. They were pulled in loose chronological order from monthly reflections I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing for a while now.
There is &amp;ldquo;nothing to attain.&amp;rdquo; I do not have to write a novel before I die, nor read 1,000 books, nor pass beyond grade 8 on the classical guitar, nor climb upward at work. It is ok to step away (and never return) from any voluntary work that stresses me out mentally, physically, and emotionally.</description>
