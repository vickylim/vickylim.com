      <description>I remember feeling like such a poser wearing my Adidas track jacket while riding the train in September &amp;lsquo;21. It made me look athletic, but I was self-conscious because I did not do any kind of exercise at all.
Next thing I know, it&amp;rsquo;s September &amp;lsquo;24 and I&amp;rsquo;m walking around with a gym bag 3x a week so that I can go train at Starting Strength. I throw in my favorite 100% cotton t-shirt, pants, water bottle, one pair of shoes for squats and another for deadlifts, my training journal, and other misc items (still looking for a &amp;ldquo;lucky troll doll&amp;rdquo;).</description>
