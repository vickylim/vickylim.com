      <description>Intentions There is no blank page, Céline Sciamma wrote on the trading card I made of her. I held this mantra since February, 2020, the month before the start of the pandemic, and I still kept struggling to write.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Nobody! Who are you? Are you – Nobody – too?
 My name is Vicky Lim. I was born a Virgo in 1987 in Chicago, Illinois.
I am an aspiring: reader, writer, librarian, tennis player, translator, tutor~teacher, and low-key YouTuber. I used to be introduced as a zinester between 2010-2017 while I was still releasing issues of Dear Jaguar and Abstract Door. I will always be, at heart, a Teen Girl on LiveJournal.</description>
