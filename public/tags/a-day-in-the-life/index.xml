      <description>So, it&amp;rsquo;s the first weekend of my winter break and I&amp;rsquo;m off for three weeks! I&amp;rsquo;m not going anywhere. My only plan is to &amp;ldquo;do nothing&amp;rdquo; and see what happens ðŸ¤ 
1 Yesterday, I attended the first meeting of the Classics Book Club to preview Wuthering Heights with 18 other people. I felt quite at ease in the library, sitting around a table with other readers, feeling like a student. It&amp;rsquo;s been so long since I&amp;rsquo;ve joined a book club.</description>

      <description>I started the day busy with my backpack, trying to decide what to bring with nowhere to go. I&amp;rsquo;m taking a couple weeks off work for a winter break and determined not to squander any minute. I could venture out of my neighborhood, walking 10-20k steps, visiting libraries and museums, and either finish reading the remaining volumes of In Search of Lost Time or study the books I&amp;rsquo;ve collected this year on a shelf dedicated to physical health, sports, and meditation.</description>
